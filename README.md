# SFND 3D Object Tracking

Welcome to the final project of the camera course. By completing all the lessons, you now have a solid understanding of keypoint detectors, descriptors, and methods to match them between successive images. Also, you know how to detect objects in an image using the YOLO deep-learning framework. And finally, you know how to associate regions in a camera image with Lidar points in 3D space. Let's take a look at our program schematic to see what we already have accomplished and what's still missing.

<img src="images/course_code_structure.png" width="779" height="414" />

In this final project, you will implement the missing parts in the schematic. To do this, you will complete four major tasks: 
1. First, you will develop a way to match 3D objects over time by using keypoint correspondences. 
2. Second, you will compute the TTC based on Lidar measurements. 
3. You will then proceed to do the same using the camera, which requires to first associate keypoint matches to regions of interest and then to compute the TTC based on those matches. 
4. And lastly, you will conduct various tests with the framework. Your goal is to identify the most suitable detector/descriptor combination for TTC estimation and also to search for problems that can lead to faulty measurements by the camera or Lidar sensor. In the last course of this Nanodegree, you will learn about the Kalman filter, which is a great way to combine the two independent TTC measurements into an improved version which is much more reliable than a single sensor alone can be. But before we think about such things, let us focus on your final project in the camera course. 

# TASK 1 - Match 3D Objects

In this task, please implement the method "matchBoundingBoxes", which takes as input both the previous and the current data frames and provides as output the ids of the matched regions of interest (i.e. the boxID property)â€œ. Matches must be the ones with the highest number of keypoint correspondences.

**Implementation Overview**

* For all the keypoint matches we get the corresponding keypoint in current frame and previous frame
* Then we check whether it is with in the previous and current frame bounding boxes
* If it is present in both the bounding boxes then we add/count it to those bounding box ids. 
* Finally we match bounding boxes which has highest number of matches/counts.

# TASK 2 - Compute Lidar-based TTC

Compute the time-to-collision in second for all matched 3D objects using only Lidar measurements from the matched bounding boxes between current and previous frame.

The sensor in this scenario will give us the distance to the closest 3D point in the path of driving. In the figure below, the closest point is indicated by a red line emanating from a Lidar sensor on top of the CAS vehicle. Based on the model of a constant-velocity we discussed in the last section, the velocity can be computed from two successive Lidar measurements.

Once the relative velocity is known, the time to collision can easily be computed by dividing the remaining distance between both vehicles by. So given a Lidar sensor which is able to take precise distance measurements, a system for TTC estimation can be developed based based on a CVM and on the set of equations shown above

Even though Lidar is a reliable sensor, erroneous measurements may still occur. E.g, a small number of points is located behind the tailgate, seemingly without connection to the vehicle. When searching for the closest points, such measurements will pose a problem as the estimated distance will be too small. There are ways to avoid such errors by post-processing the point cloud, but there will be no guarantee that such problems will never occur in practice.

# TASK 3 - Associate Keypoint Correspondences with Bounding Boxes

Before a TTC estimate can be computed in the next exercise, you need to find all keypoint matches that belong to each 3D object. You can do this by simply checking whether the corresponding keypoints are within the region of interest in the camera image. All matches which satisfy this condition should be added to a vector. The problem you will find is that there will be outliers among your matches. To eliminate those, I recommend that you compute a robust mean of all the euclidean distances between keypoint matches and then remove those that are too far away from the mean

# TASK 4 - Compute Camera-based TTC

With a 2D camera however, the process of TTC computation is more complicated: First, the camera does not perform 3D measurements but only captures a 2D image of the scene. Second, we need to reliably and accurately identify vehicles in order to track their motion over time. To compute the TTC, we need to rely on the scale change of a vehicle (i.e. its increase in size on the image sensor in successive frames).

We detect keypoint correspondences by calculating euclidean distances.Please see picture below. If it were possible to locate uniquely identifiable keypoints that could be tracked from one frame to the next, we could use the distance between all keypoints on the vehicle relative to each other to compute a robust estimate of the height ratio in out TTC equation.

# TASK 5 and 6 - Performance Evaluation

This exercise is about conducting tests with the final project code, especially with regard to the Lidar part. Look for several examples where you have the impression that the Lidar-based TTC estimate is way off. Once you have found those, describe your observations.

This last exercise is about running the different detector / descriptor combinations and looking at the differences in TTC estimation. Find out which methods perform best and also include several examples where camera-based TTC estimation is way off. As with Lidar, describe your observations again and also look into potential reasons. This is the last task in the final project.
